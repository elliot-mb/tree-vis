# 2-3-4 Tree visualiser [(Deployed)](https://elliotmb.dev/tree-vis/)
A visual learning tool providing an interactive 2-3-4 tree (B-Tree of order 4) in the browser.

Numbers may be inserted into the tree in real time. I plan to add search and deletion next.

## What's it for?
This project was inspired by my 2nd-year Algorithms unit, and was spurred on by my need to revise this datastructure. I had been meaning to implement many different concepts in this unit for a while, as it's a very interesting unit to me.
